React Native tracker for [Heap](https://heapanalytics.com).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @heap/react-native-heap
```

We will be supporting `npm link` in a future release. Please follow the manual setup instructions below for the time being.

### Manual setup - iOS with Cocoapods

If you don't have a Podfile in the `ios` folder of your React Native project, follow this guide to create one: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies

Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "react-native-heap", path: "../node_modules/@heap/react-native-heap"
```

Then run:

```bash
pod install
```

You're done! :tada:

### Manual setup - Android

In some cases, simply doing `react-native link` will correctly set up the tracker on Android.
However, if you encounter any issues (either with the command itself or at compile-time/run-time),
you should revert any changes made by `react-native link` and try the following steps, instead.

Add the following to your `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
include ':react-native-heap'
project(':react-native-heap').projectDir =
    new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@heap/react-native-heap/android')
```

Then add the following to `app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation project(':react-native-heap')
```

Import the package and add it to your app's MainApplication:

```java

@Override
import com.heapanalytics.reactnative.RNHeapLibraryPackage;
...
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
  return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
    new MainReactPackage(),
    new RNHeapLibraryPackage()
  );
}
```

If you are seeing runtime warnings at startup mentioning `Heap: Could not find BuildConfig`, add the
following line to the resources section of `res/values/strings.xml`:

```xml
<string name="com.heapanalytics.android.buildConfigPkgName">com.your_package_name</string>
```

and replace `com.your_package_name` with the package name from the manifest tag in `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Usage

```js
// Import Heap.
import Heap from '@heap/react-native-heap';

// Start Heap.
Heap.setAppId('my-app-id');

// Identify your user.
Heap.identify('123456');
Heap.addUserProperties({ name: 'John', age: 54 });

// Add event properties (these persist across sessions).
Heap.addEventProperties({ isLoggedIn: true });

// You can remove a specific property or clear everything.
Heap.removeEventProperty('isLoggedIn');
Heap.clearEventProperties();

// To track an event, use:
Heap.track('signed-up', { isPaid: true, amount: 20 });
```
